	<h1>Fast Car Lyrics</h1>
	<h3>by Tracy Chapman</h3>

	<img src=d:/tracychapman.jpg>	
<div>You got a fast car</div>
<div>I want a ticket to anywhere</div>
<div>Maybe we make a deal</div>
<div>Anyplace is better</div>
<div>Starting from zero got nothing to lose</div>
<div>Maybe we'll make something</div>
<div>Me, myself I got nothing to prove</div>


<p></p>	
<div>You got a fast car</div>
<div>I got a plan to get us out of here</div>
<div>I been working at the convenience store</div>
<div>Managed to save just a little bit of money</div>
<div>Won't have to drive too far</div>
<div>Just 'cross the border and into the city</div>
<div>You and I can both get jobs</div>
<div>And finally see what it means to be living</div>

<p></p>
<div>You see my old man's got a problem </div>
<div>He live with the bottle that's the way it is</div>
<div>He says his body's too old for working</div>
<div>His body's too young to look like his</div>
<div>My mama went off and left him</div>
<div>She wanted more from life than he could give</div>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<div>I said somebody's got to take care of him</div>
<div>So I quit school and that's what I did</div>

<p></p>
